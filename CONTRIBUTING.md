# Contributing to Terrible Plugin
This repository is home to a terrible plugin, that being said we have some rules about contributing.

- The server must start and the plugin must load.
- Keep a good development experience. By this I mean, follow conventions. Don't remove everything from the .gitignore,
follow naming conventions, etc. It's more about bad code itself than about bad naming conventions, a terrible experience, etc.

Basically as long as the code is bad, the server starts and the plugin loads, theres a very good chance it will get merged.
